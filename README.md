# Tkinter-Image-Viewer
This a is simple Image Viewer interface built using Tkinter and PIL.

To display image in Python is as simple as that. But, the problem is PhotoImage class only supports GIF and PGM/PPM formats.
 
The more generalized formats are JPEG/JPG and PNG. To open and display with those formats, we need help of ImageTk and Image classes from PIL(photo imaging Library) package.
